# Description

An automatic caption generator using deep learning techniques for the Flickr8k image dataset, preprocessing includes image resizing, normalization, and text tokenization.

Employed pre-trained CNN- VGG16 to extract high-level features from images (transfer learning ) ,fine-tuned the CNN layers to adapt to the specific image-caption generation task and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for generating descriptive captions.

Employed evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and CIDEr to assess the quality and relevance of generated captions.
